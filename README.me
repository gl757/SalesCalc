# SalesCalc

sales commission calculator

This is a personal project coded in C++ originally worked on in Codeblocks and then later refined in Visual Studio. It is a commission calculator based on how the sales commission worked at a previous job in car sales. I have worked alot in retail sales and typically there is a automated way to track the money you're making whenever you complete sales, however in car sales, you had to track it yourself manually. I decided to make a commission calculator based on the mini (the minimum amount you get if you don't get a high front end gross on a vehicle) and the packs (if you do get over what would only net you a mini) and how it would all break down exactly so that you know exactly what you would be making as you make your sales. There are multiple variables and calculations involved to get you down to the actual dollar and cent. The point of this project is to demonstrate the fundamental understanding of coding in c++ utiilizing things such as functions, structures, logic and header files.
